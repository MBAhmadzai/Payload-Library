## Contributing
Once you have developed your payload, you are encouraged to contribute to this repository by submitting a Pull Request. Reviewed and Approved pull requests will add your payload to this repository, where they may be publically available.

Please adhere to the following best practices and style guide when submitting a payload.

### Naming Conventions
Please give your payload a unique and descriptive name. Do not use spaces in payload names. Each payload should be submit into its own directory, with `-` or `_` used in place of spaces, to one of the categories such as exfiltration, phishing, remote_access or recon. Do not create your own category.

### Comments
Payloads should begin with comments specifying at the very least the name of the payload and author. Additional information such as a brief description, the target, any dependencies / prerequisites and the LED status used is helpful.

### Configuration Options
Configurable options should be specified in variables at the top of the payload.txt file

    # Options
    SSH_USER="username"
	SSH_HOST="hostname"
	MSF_PORT=31337

### LED
The payload should use common payload states rather than unique color/pattern combinations when possible with an LED command preceding the Stage or `NETMODE`.

	LED SETUP
	NETMODE NAT

Common payload states include a `SETUP`, with may include a `FAIL` if certain conditions are not met. This is typically followed by either a single `ATTACK` or multiple `STAGEs`. More complex payloads may include a `SPECIAL` function to wait until certain conditions are met. Payloads commonly end with a `CLEANUP` phase, such as moving and deleting files or stopping services. A payload may `FINISH` when the objective is complete and the device is safe to eject or turn off. These common payload states correspond to `LED` states.
